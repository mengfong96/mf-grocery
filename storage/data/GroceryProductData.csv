Chicken wings,"Chicken wings have become ubiquitous with sports and drinking culture, but they're well-worth your time (and appetite) on any occasion. They're simple, easy to cook, full of protein, budget-friendly and a fun, hearty finger food for parties and weeknight dinners alike. Try them baked, fried, smoked, grilled or made into soup. No matter how you eat chicken wings, they're a versatile, delicious ingredient worth learning more about.There are three types of wings you'll find at the market: the whole wing, the flat, and the drumette (the latter being the part that looks like a mini-drumstick). When you see these two parts together, it's easy to imagine the wing of a bird. Before the wing is broken apart, the drumette comes attached to the breast. Chicken wings also have a wing tip, but those aren't often included in sectioned-off bits of the cut .Decide how you want your wings before you prep. For a dry rub, make sure the meat has been dried with paper towels first to allow the mix to adhere to the skin. Wings can also be marinated or brined before cooking to seal in moisture and flavor.
Fried wings have a huge following, and cooking them in a deep-fryer is an easy way to get the job done. Roasting or baking in the oven is a simple way to cook them (roast on top of a baking rack for crisper skin), and for extra flavor, chicken wings can be smoked or grilled.
